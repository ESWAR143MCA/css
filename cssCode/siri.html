    <p class="ommo">Siri, whenever I see you, the first thing that wins my heart is your beautiful smile – it’s truly magical and makes everything around you brighter. The way you carry yourself with such confidence and grace makes you look even more special. Your dressing sense is always stylish and unique, and it perfectly reflects your personality. Every time you walk in, you bring a charm that’s hard to ignore. Beyond looks, your character is so strong – you’re kind, respectful, and caring towards everyone. The way you talk and behave shows your maturity, and it always leaves a lasting impression. You are someone who can inspire, attract, and spread positivity just with your presence.

<p class="oppo"> <span class="oyee">I used to call you Siri, but slowly that name turned into Potti,</span> because it feels more close to my heart and filled with love. Every time I say Potti, it carries my care, my affection, and all the feelings I have for you. Your smile, your behaviour, and your sweet nature make this name even more special, <span class="ore">because it’s not just a nickname – it’s my way of showing how much you mean to me. Potti, you are my happiness, my inspiration, and the one who makes my world brighter every day. </span>❤️</p>
